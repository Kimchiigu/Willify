                                            The song acknowledges the obstacles that often come with love.

They also recognize that being apart from each other is difficult, but they find comfort knowing that they will always find each other in their dreams.<br><br>
                                            The bridge offers a sense of hope and encouragement for those who are facing difficult times in relationships. It suggests that love is the light that guides them through darkness, and that by following that light, they can overcome any challenge.<br><br>

The reference to the moonlight illuminating the protagonist's skin hints at the magical yet transient quality of life's most memorable moments. <br><br>
                                            The repeated message of 'even when the night changes, it will never change me and you' underscores the idea of finding stability and comfort in cherished relationships amidst life's constant flux.<br><br>
                                            Overall, 'Night Changes' serves as a reminder to live in the present, appreciate fleeting moments, and hold onto the people who anchor us in the face of life's changes."

                            data-biography="This song is about someone reflecting on a broken relationship that used to be filled with dreams of a happy ending. The narrator is at a payphone trying to call home - his former partner - reminiscing about how all the plans they made for two fell apart. <br><br>
                                            He reflects on how he gave his love out of love expecting the same in return, only for it to be thrown away. The chorus expresses his regret that he's wasted all of his change, or energy and money, on someone who no longer cares. In the post-chorus, he states how 'fairytales are full of shit' - his relationship did not turn out to be the happily ever after that he expected."

                            data-biography="The song 'Talking to the Moon' by Bruno Mars conveys the feeling of an intense longing for someone who is not physically present. The lyrics describe a sense of loneliness, as the speaker sits by themselves at night under the stars, talking to the moon in hopes that the person they miss is doing the same. <br><br>
                                            The strong emotions conveyed by the speaker's desire to reach out to the person they miss are paralleled with the perception of madness by those around them. However, the speaker maintains hope that the person they miss is listening and responding, a belief that the speaker clings onto through conversation with the moon. <br><br>
                                            The lyrics suggest that this is not a temporary feeling, but rather one that seems to persist each night. It appears that the speaker is willing to do almost anything to get the attention of the person they miss, even if it means talking to an inanimate object in the hopes that their words can somehow travel to the other side to reach them. <br><br>
                                            Overall, 'Talking to the Moon' is a poignant expression of the pain of separation and the power of hope in such a situation."

He explained in his own quirky way, on how he confronted his vulnerabilities and transformed his pain into profound musical expression, fearlessly shedding light on his struggles and challenges.<br><br>
                            Mental health has been front and centre of today's generation zeitgeist and only though the conversation is not new, Hartono managed to include themes such as self-love, post-trauma, and vulnerability to the unknown on his music. In other words, he transformed them into anthems for the masses to live on!"

This track unfolds as a vivid journey through the heart's intricate pathways, where each note and word carries the depth of genuine, unguarded emotion.<br><br>
                                            In Shallow Water, Afgan steps into the role of a musical cartographer, charting the complex terrains of love.

                            data-biography="'Broken Melodies' by NCT DREAM is a song about missing someone and the pain of being separated from them. The lyrics describe the sadness and loneliness that comes with being far apart from a loved one, as well as the longing to be with them again. <br><br>
                                            The song talks about the importance of a partner in completing our lives and the way we feel incomplete when we are missing someone we love. The lyrics mention that the distance between people creates noise and broken melodies that make it hard to be heard or to understand one another. <br><br>
                                            The verses talk about how the absence of a loved one makes everything feel incomplete and empty. However, the chorus gives hope by acknowledging that love is a powerful and life-changing force, even in the midst of distance and loneliness. The repetition of 'Broken Melodies' throughout the song speaks to how even though life goes on, without that loved one, it feels like something essential is missing. <br><br>
                                            The bridge provides a glimmer of hope, that despite the difficulties, it is worth it to hold on and fight for that special connection. Overall, 'Broken Melodies' illustrates the pain and longing that can come with a long-distance relationship, but it also acknowledges the power of love to overcome that distance and bring people closer together."

                            data-biography="The song 'Cupid (Twin Version)'' by FIFTY FIFTY is about the pain of unrequited love and disillusionment with the concept of love itself. The lyrics convey the feeling of being a 'hopeless romantic' surrounded by happy couples, while struggling to find love oneself. The protagonist is questioning the validity of love, wondering if it is worth all the heartache and loneliness that comes with it.<br><br>
                                            The chorus expresses frustration with Cupid, the god of love, who is supposed to bring people together but has failed the protagonist. The post-chorus reinforces this sentiment, stating that Cupid is 'so dumb' for not being able to help the protagonist find love.<br><br>
                                            The bridge has a glimmer of hope, with the protagonist seeking someone to share their feelings with. However, they acknowledge that they may be a 'fool for love,'' implying a sense of vulnerability and fear of getting hurt again.<br><br>
                                            Overall, the song paints a picture of someone struggling to reconcile their desire for love with the pain and disappointment that often accompanies it. It highlights the emotional toll of unrequited love and the difficulty of finding a genuine connection with someone."

                            data-biography="The song 'Eve, Psyche & The Bluebeard's wife' by LE SSERAFIM seems to be a commentary on societal expectations and the pressures to conform to them, particularly for women. The lyrics describe feeling like a mess but still being well dressed and fearless, indicating that the pressure to maintain a certain image can be overwhelming even when one is feeling overwhelmed and distressed. <br><br>
                            The post-chorus lines 'I wish for what's forbidden' suggest a desire to break free from societal norms and explore taboo subjects. The references to Eve and 'take it on the chain' allude to the story of Adam and Eve and the punishment they received for disobeying God's commands. The chorus of 'boom, boom, boom, my heart is beating' seems to represent a sense of urgency and a desire to break free from these constraints. <br><br>
                            Overall, the song seems to suggest that it's important to be true to oneself and not to be swayed by societal expectations."

                            data-biography="The song 'Super Shy' by NewJeans (English Translation) portrays the feelings of shyness and nervousness when it comes to expressing romantic interest in someone. The lyrics showcase a longing to connect with someone, but the protagonist's shyness prevents them from taking the initiative.<br><br>
                                            In the chorus, the repetition of 'I'm super shy, super shy' emphasizes the overwhelming bashfulness that the protagonist experiences. They express a desire to make the person they are interested in theirs, but their shyness holds them back.<br><br>
                                            The first verse, sung by Hyein and Minji, delves into the desire to spend time with the person they like. They suggest going somewhere to talk and get to know each other better. The lyrics imply that the protagonist's feelings intensify when the person acknowledges them as their dream.<br><br>
                                            The refrain sung by Hanni, Danielle, and Minji emphasizes the fact that the person of interest barely knows the protagonist's name. This highlights the disconnect between their emotions and the lack of familiarity the other person has with them.<br><br>
                                            In the second verse, Haerin and Hanni express confusion over their sudden shyness despite being typically talkative. The person they like is described as special and aware of their own allure, which further intensifies the protagonist's feelings of admiration.<br><br>
                                            Overall, 'Super Shy' conveys the internal struggle faced by the protagonist who desires to open up to their love interest but struggles with shyness and fear of rejection. It illustrates the universal experience of feeling nervous and hesitant when it comes to confessing romantic feelings."
